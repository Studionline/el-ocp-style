                <li>Prepare two anchor charts that are exactly the same as the two student handouts: Text Feature Scavenger Hunt recording form and vocabulary notebooks.</li>
                <li>This lesson introduces students’ vocabulary notebooks. Allow more time in other parts of the school day to reinforce this important new routine.</li>
                <li>When students work in their vocabulary notebooks, they might not be able to define all the words only in context. Tell them to give it their best guess. When reviewing their vocabulary notebooks, note the words students didn’t know. Out of these, prioritize the one or two most important words for students to know, and define them for the class the next day. Consider using dictionary.com or unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate.htm and projecting the words on the screen for students the next time they work in their vocabulary notebooks, or give them a written definition on chart paper.</li> 
                <li>The purpose of these notebooks is to support students to carefully attend to words. It provides them with repeated opportunities to practice finding the meaning of words in context. The important thing is not that they memorize these words, but that they have a deeper awareness of words they don’t know and strategies to help them find the meaning of any unknown words. There is no need to quiz students.</li> 
                <li>Also create an Interactive Word Wall so that students can refer to these words throughout the unit.</li>
